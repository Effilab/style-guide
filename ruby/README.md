# Ruby style guide

Add the following code to a `.rubocop.yml` file at the root of your ruby project.

```
inherit_from: https://git.effilab-local.com/world/style-guide/raw/master/ruby/.rubocop.yml
```

You may also want to gitignore the cache file that will be generated the first time you run Rubocop.
